My take on Mule ESB:




 

What is ESB?


	
Enterprise service bus
	An architecture with set of rules to integrate our applications. Establishes a communication bus and replaces our point to point integration
	establishes communication between bus and application.
	Reduces time to market.


 

Mule ESB:

 


	
Scale application up and down based on our need
	Completely component bases architecture, so we can easily reuse them
	Introduced mule data source between point to point architecture 
	loosely coupled and highly scalable
	Data exchange can be of any format


 

A unique selling point of Mule I believe is that mule is not build on any existing application. It's vendor- neutral so different vendor implementations can be plug into it.

 

Integrate anything from a "plain old Java object" (POJO) to a component from another framework.
Messages can be in any format from SOAP to binary image files
Mule can dramatically decrease time to market and increases productivity
