Linux is more reliable when compared to Windows. Linux will rock with its top-notch design, built-in security resulting un-parallel up-time.  Developers of Linux distros are much active and release major and minor updates from time to time.  
Linux allows a user to control every aspect of the operating systems. As Linux is an open-source operating system, it allows a user to modify its source (even source code of applications) itself as per the user requirements.

File Manipulation:
ls: hows the files /directories in your current directory
ls -R: shows all the files not only in directories but also subdirectories
ls-a : view hidden files
ls-la: shows file details wit permissions

this will basically tell us about permission - size - file owner - owner group - file sixe in bits - data and time - directory of file

creating new file:
cat is a very strong command that can be used to copy , combine and create text file

Step 01: cat> file1 to create file named file1
Step 02: Enter file contents
Step 03: Ctrl+D to exit editing mode

Combining to files to new one:
>cat file1 file2 > newfile
Once after this command we won't get any conformation response. This is because Bash Shell (Terminal) is silent type.  Shell Commands will never give you a confirmation message like "OK" or "Command Successfully Executed". It will only show a message when something goes wrong or when an error has occurred.

Deleting a file:
>rm file1
Moving files:
we need sudo command to transfer files
>sudo mv test /home/yousra/Files

Creatng directoty:
>mkdir newdir
OR
>mkdir /temp/newdir

similarly rmdir directory remove a directory but make sure there's no file inide the directory

Reference book of linux:
>man ls 
will give contents of ls command
>history
to check history
