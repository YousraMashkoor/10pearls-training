Title: Deploy ML model on heroku
Source: 

This tutorial went through detailed step an how to prepare, clean and make a simple mode, convert it to web service and deploy the model on heroku 

MODEL INTO WEBSERVICE:

This step is to package the model into a web service that, when given the data through a POST request, returns (in our case) the MPG (Miles per Gallon) predictions as a response.

Flask gets you started with very little code and you don’t need to worry about the complexity of handling with HTTP requests and responses.

1.Create a new directory for your flask application.
2.Set up a dedicated environment with dependencies installed using pip.
3.Install the following packages:
pandas
numpy
sklearn
flask
gunicorn
seaborn

4.activate this environment and start developing a simple endpoint to test the application:

app = Flask('app')
@app.route('/test', methods=['GET'])
def test():
    return 'Pinging Model Application!!'

if __name__ == ‘__main__’:
    app.run(debug=True, host=’0.0.0.0', port=9696)


DEPLOYING TO HEROKU:

1.Create Procfile in main dir
2.Add followin content
>web: gunicorn wsgi:app
3.Now, create a wsgi.py file and add:
##importing the app from main file
from main import app

if __name__ == “__main__”: 
    app.run()

4. delete run code from main.py and create requrements.txt
5. Now initialize your git repository and commit your code
6. login to heroku cli
>heroku login
>heroku create <name of your app>
>git push heroku master

And you're Done!
